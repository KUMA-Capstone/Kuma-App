# Summary

This project will create an application called Kuma (Koneksi untuk Memahami Anak Istimewa). Kuma is aimed at autistic children from four to seventeen years old. Autism is a developmental condition that affects how individuals perceive the world and interact with others. According to Autistica, seven of ten autistic people have a mental health condition such as anxiety, depression or OCD (mentalhealth.org.uk). Furthermore, according to autismspectrum.org, 46% of children (3-6 years old) and 70% (10-14 years old) have at least one mental health condition. One of the problems faced by people with autism is mood problems, so Kuma is here to track their daily moods. Parents, teachers, or therapists can input the emotional experiences of autistic children for a day, and the system will provide results in the form of a Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS). By knowing their daily mood, parents can evaluate their autistic children's day and plan a better agenda for tomorrow, also their parents can learn patterns of which days their autistic children's mood is not good. We believe this project could help many parents who have autistic children to have a better understanding of their children's mental condition.
